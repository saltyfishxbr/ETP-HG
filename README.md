# ETP-HG
This is the source code of ETH-TP for HighD dataset. You can run visualization.py to check the result of pretrained model.

If you are interested in training, you can first generate the processed data and prepare a graph structure dataset by running data_preprocess_HighD.py and datasets_HighD.py. Then run data_train_HighD.py to train your model. Configurations can be modified in configs.py.
