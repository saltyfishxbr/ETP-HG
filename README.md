# ETP-HG
This is the source code of ETH-TP for HighD dataset. You can run visualization.py to check the result of pretrained model. You can download the pretrained model and processed dataset via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19j2SMnS9TMHewTTBBTbhSrFxWUgw5QZf?usp=drive_link

There is a figure of result in this repository.

If you are interested in training, you can first generate the processed data and prepare a graph structure dataset by running data_preprocess_HighD.py and datasets_HighD.py. Then run data_train_HighD.py to train your model. Configurations can be modified in configs.py.
